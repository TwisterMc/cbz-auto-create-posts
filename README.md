CBZ Auto Create Posts
===================

A WordPress plugin that auto generates loriem ipsum posts in cat, bacon or zombie. Tell it how many you want, pick which flavor, and it creates them all in a few seconds.

To Install:

1. Download the zip file and upload the whole folder to your plugins directory.
2. Activate.
3. CBZ Auto Create Posts will then show up under the Tools menu in WordPress.

If you want to help make it better, fork and pull. (I think I said that right.)

Also, if you like to draw cute zombie cats eating bacon let me know.
